#uberdeploy

A little deployment tool for uberspace.

##Install

Clone repo and add `/bin/uberdeploy.sh` to PATH.

##Example

Go to a directory where you want to place your project

Initialize a new project with

`uberdeploy create myProject`

After some questions and a bit of time... switch to new project directory. 

`cd myProject`

Make some changes, add some files/directories - simply work on your project...

Ready for deployment? Type:

`uberdeploy deploy firstDeploy`

**That's it! =)**
